Sphinx Language Support
=======================

This project provides tools to improve the authoring experience of working with :external+sphinx:doc:`Sphinx <index>` documentation projects.

Principally, it provides:

- a :ref:`sphinx extension <sphinx_indexer>` to generate an database of key information from a Sphinx project,
- a :ref:`language server <sphinx_lsp>` to provide code intelligence for Sphinx projects, and
- a :ref:`VS Code extension <vscode_extension>` to run the language server.

.. _quickstart:

Quick Start
-----------

#. See the :external+sphinx:doc:`Sphinx guide <usage/quickstart>` for setting up a Sphinx project.

#. Within your sphinx Python environment,
   install the :ref:`sphinx_indexer <sphinx_indexer>` package,
   and add the extension to your :file:`conf.py` file:

   .. code-block:: python

      extensions = [..., "sphinx_indexer"]

#. Run the the sphinx build.

#. Either add a :file:`sphinx.toml` file in the project root
   or add to an existing :file:`pyproject.toml` file the following content:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: :file:`sphinx.toml`

        .. code-block:: toml

            srcdir = "."           # or the relative path to your source folder
            lsp.outdir = "_build"  # or the relative path to your build folder

      .. tab-item:: :file:`pyproject.toml`

        .. code-block:: toml

            [tool.sphinx]
            srcdir = "."           # or the relative path to your source folder
            lsp.outdir = "_build"  # or the relative path to your build folder

#. Open your project in VS Code and install the :ref:`Sphinx Language Support <vscode_extension>` extension.

#. Try out the features defined in the :ref:`Extension features <vscode_extension-features>`.

.. tip::

    The language server does currently handle re-running the Sphinx build when the source files change.

    For this you may want to check out `sphinx-autobuild <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx-autobuild>`_.
