VS Code Extension
=================

The Sphinx Language Support extension provides features for working with Sphinx projects in Visual Studio Code.

Features
--------

Sphinx builds
.............

To launch  a build for a source file of a Sphinx project (``rst`` or ``md``), you can either:

- Click on the editor title icon:

  .. image:: /_images/build_editor_icon.png
     :alt: Build editor icon
     :align: center

- Right-click in the editor and select "Launch Sphinx Build "

- Right-click on a file in the Explorer panel and select "Launch Sphinx Build"

If you have multiple build configurations for your project, this will first prompt you to select the build configuration to use.

If a build configuration is found/selected (see :ref:`configuration`), then the command will be launched in a Terminal.

To guard against multiple builds running at the same time, for the same output directory,
terminals are re-used for the same output directory.

.. note::

  By default, new terminals will open with the workspace folder as the working directory,
  and also first apply configured platform settings, such as loading the selected Python environment.

.. tip::

    The extension does not currently handle automatically re-running the Sphinx build when the source files change.

    For this you may want to check out `sphinx-autobuild <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx-autobuild>`_.

HTML Preview
............

The following commands will look for the ``preview`` or ``default`` build configuration,
to determine the relative path to the built HTML file (see :ref:`configuration`).

To open a preview of the HTML output for a source file (``rst`` or ``md``),
you can either:

- Click on the editor title icon:

  .. image:: /_images/preview_editor_icon.png
     :alt: HTML preview editor icon
     :align: center

- Right-click in the editor and select "Open Sphinx Preview" or "Open Sphinx Preview (External)":

  .. image:: /_images/preview_editor_menu.png
     :alt: HTML preview context menu
     :align: center
     :height: 150px

- Right-click on a file in the Explorer panel and select "Open Sphinx Preview" or "Open Sphinx Preview (External)":

  .. image:: /_images/preview_explorer_menu.png
     :alt: HTML preview explorer menu
     :align: center
     :height: 200px

Selecting *External* will open the preview in your default browser,
otherwise it will open in a new tab in the editor.

.. note::

  This extension uses `Live Preview <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server>`__ to provide the preview.
  See this extension for more configuration options.

  For example, you may want to increase the ``livePreview.previewDebounceDelay``,
  if working on a remote filesystem.
