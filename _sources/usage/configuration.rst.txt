File discovery
--------------

Similar to `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery>`_,
the LSP supports hierarchical configuration, such that the "closest" config file in the directory hierarchy is used for every individual file,
with all paths in the config file being resolved relative to the directory containing that config file.

Configuration can be in a :file:`sphinx.toml` or :file:`pyproject.toml` file,
although note any :file:`pyproject.toml` that lacks a ``[tool.sphinx]`` section will be ignored.

For example, given the following directory structure::

    project/
    ├── docs1/
    │   ├── conf.py
    │   └── doc1.rst
    │   └── sphinx.toml
    ├── docs2/
    │   ├── conf.py
    │   └── doc2.rst
    └── sphinx.toml

The configuration for :file:`doc1.rst` will be read from :file:`project/docs1/sphinx.toml`,
whereas for :file:`doc2.rst` it will be read from :file:`project/sphinx.toml`.
