## Workflow

1. Create a notebook with some content!
2. optionaly create a .bib file and logo image
3. Adjust the notebook and cell metadata. 
4. Run the run_nbconvert.sh script for either the specific notebook, or a folder containing multiple notebooks. 
5. A converted folder will be created, into which final .tex .pdf and _viewpdf.html files will be output, named by the notebook or folder input

The default latex template (latex_hide_input_output.tplx) outputs all raw/markdown cells (unless tagged latex_ignore), and then only output cells with latex_figure, latex_table or latex_equation meta tags (see [Metadata Tags](#metadata-tags)).

## Setting up the environment

Using [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is recommended for package management, 
in order to create self contained environments with specific versions of packages. 
The main packages required are the Jupyter notebook, Jupyter [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
and [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) (for conversion to latex):

	conda create --name ipyreport -c conda-forge jupyter pandoc
	
For converting to PDF, the TeX document preparation ecosystem is required (an in particular [latexmk](http://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html)), which can be installed from:

- Linux: [TeX Live](http://tug.org/texlive/)
- macOS (OS X): [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/)
- Windows: [MikTex](http://www.miktex.org/)

For helpful extensions to the notebooks core capabilities (like a toc sidebar):

	conda install --name ipyreport jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
	
A more extensive setup of useful packages (used to create the example) 
are listed in ![conda_packages.txt](conda_packages.txt) 
and an environment can be created directly from this using conda:

	conda create --name ipyreport -c conda-forge -c matsci --file conda_packages.txt
	
## Setting up a Notebook 

For improved latex/pdf output, ![notebooks/ipynb_latex_setup.py](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/blob/master/conda_packages.txt) contains import and setup code for the notebook and a number of common packages and functions, including:

- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sympy, ...
- `images_hconcat`, `images_vconcat` and `images_gridconcat` functions, which use the PIL/Pillow package to create a single image from multiple images (with specified arrangement)

To use this script, in the first cell of a notebook, insert:

	from ipynb_latex_setup import *
	
It is recommended that you also set this cell as an initialisation cell (i.e. have `"init_cell": true` in the metadata)

## Running run_nbconvert script

To see all options for this script:

	./run_nbconvert.sh -h

For example, to convert the Example.ipynb notebook:

	./run_nbconvert.sh -b bibliographies/example.bib -l logos/logo_example.png notebooks/Example.ipynb

If a folder is input, then the .ipynb files it contains are processed and combined in 'natural' sorted order, i.e. 2_name.ipynb before 10_name.ipynb

The current `nbconvert --to pdf` does not correctly resolve references and citations (since it copies the files to a temporary directory). Therefore nbconvert is only used for the initial `nbconvert --to latex` phase, followed by using `latexmk` to create the pdf and correctly resolve everything.
 
## Metadata Tags

For **titlepage**, enter in notebook metadata:

```json
{
	"latex_metadata": {
	"author": "Authors Name",
	"email": "authors@email.com",
	"supervisors": [
	"First Supervisor",
	"Second Supervisor"
	],
	"title": "Main-Title",
	"subtitle": "Sub-Title",
	"tagline": "A tagline for the report.",
	"institution": [
	"Institution1",
	"Institution2"
	],
	"logo": "logo_example"
	}
}
```

- all keys are optional
- if there is no title, then the notebook filename will be used
- if run_nbconvert.sh is called on a folder, then the meta data from the first notebook will be used
- logo should be the name (without extension) of the logo, then use e.g. `run_nbconvert.sh -l logos/logo_example.png Example.ipynb`

To  **ignore a markdown cell**:

	"latex_ignore" : true

For  **figures**, enter in cell metadata:

	  "latex_figure": {
	    "caption": "Figure caption.",
	    "label": "fig:flabel",
	    "placement": "H"
	    "widefigure": false
	  }

- `placement` is optional and constitutes using a placement arguments for the figure (e.g. \begin{figure}[H]). See https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Positioning_images_and_tables.
- `widefigure` is optional and constitutes expanding the figure to the page width (i.e. \begin{figure*}) (placement arguments will then be ignored)

For  **tables**, enter in cell metadata:

	  "latex_table": {
	    "caption": "Table caption.",
	    "label": "tbl:tlabel"
	    "placement": "H"
        "alternate": "gray!20"
	  }

- `placement` is optional and constitutes using a placement arguments for the table (e.g. \begin{table}[H]). See https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Positioning_images_and_tables.
- `alternate` is optional and constitutes using alternating colors for the table rows (e.g. \rowcolors{2}{gray!25}{white}). See https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/5365/107738.


For  **equations**, enter in cell metadata:

	  "latex_equation": {
	    "label": "eqn:elabel"
	  }

label is optional

### Captions in a Markdown cell

Especially for long captions, it would be prefered that captions can be viewed and edited in a notebook Markdown cell, rather than hidden in the metadata. Enter the following (experimental) approach, implemented in `latex_hide_input_output`.

If a **markdown cell** has the metadata tag:

	"latex_caption": "fig:example_mpl"

Then, instead of it being input directly into the .tex file, it will be stored as a variable;

- the variable's name is created from the latex_caption value
- the variable's value is the first paragraph of the markdown text (i.e. nothing after a \n) 

If a subsequent **figure or table** cell has a label matching any stored variable name, for example:

	"latex_figure": {
	"caption": "",
	"label": "fig:example_mpl",
	}

Then its caption will be overriden with that variable. 

The manner in which this works can be found in ![converted/Example.tex](converted/Example.tex):

	\newcommand{\kyfigcexampleumpl}{A matplotlib figure, with the caption set in the markdowncell above the figure.}

	\begin{figure}
	        \begin{center}\adjustimage{max size={0.9\linewidth}{0.4\paperheight}}{Example_files/Example_14_0.pdf}\end{center}
			\ifdefined\kyfigcexampleumpl
			 \caption{\kyfigcexampleumpl}
			\else
			 \caption{}
			\fi
	        \label{fig:example_mpl}
	    \end{figure}

Note, this approach has the implicit contraint that markdown caption cells must be above the corresponding figure/table to be output in the latex/pdf.

## Citations and Bibliography

Using Zotero's Firefox plugin and [Zotero Better Bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/tag/1.6.100) for;

- automated .bib file updating 
- drag and drop cite keys \cite{kirkeminde_thermodynamic_2012}
- `latexmk -bibtex -pdf` (in run_nbconvert.sh) handles creation of the bibliography
- \usepackage{doi} turns the DOI numbers into url links

    - in Zotero-Better-Bibtex I have the option set to only export DOI, if both DOI and URL are present.
	
Please note, at the time of writing, Better BibTeX does not support Zotero 5.0 ([issue#555](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/555)). For now I have turned off auto-updates of Zotero, though this is probably not wise for long ([Zotero 5 Discussion](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/comment/277434/#Comment_277434)).

Can use: 

	<cite data-cite="kirkeminde_thermodynamic_2012">(Kirkeminde, 2012)</cite> 
	
to make it look better in html, but not specifically available for drag and drop in Zotero 
	
## Dealing with external data

A goal for scientific publishing is automated reproducibility of analyses, which the Jupyter notebook excels at. But, more than that, it should be possible to efficiently reproduce the analysis with different data sets. This entails having **one point of access** to a data set within the notebook, rather than having copy-pasted data into variables, i.e. this:

    data = read_in_data('data_key')
    variable1 = data.key1
    variable2 = data.key2
    ...

rather than this:

    variable1 = 12345
    variable2 = 'something'
    ...

The best-practice for this (in my opinion) is to use the JSON format (as long as the data isn't [relational](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)), because it is:

- applicable for any data structure
- lightweight and easy to read and edit
- has a simple read/write mapping to python objects  (using [json](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html))
- widely used (especially in web technologies)

A good way to store multiple bits of JSON data is in a [mongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) and accessing it via [pymongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/). This will also make it easy to move all the data to a cloud server at a later time, if required.

    conda install pymongo

But, if the data is coming from files output from different simulation or experimental code, where the user has no control of the output format. Then writing JSON parsers may be the way to go, and this is where  [jsonextended](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/jsonextended) comes in, which implements:

- a lightweight plugin system to define bespoke classes for parsing different file extensions and data types.
- a 'lazy loader' for treating an entire directory structure as a nested dictionary.

For example:

```python
from jsonextended import plugins, edict
plugins.load_plugins_dir('path/to/folder_of_parsers','parsers')
data = edict.LazyLoad('path/to/data')
variable1 = data.folder1.file1_json.key1
variable2 = data[['folder1','file1.json','key2']]
variable3 = data[['folder1','file2.csv','key1']]
variable4 = data[['folder2','subfolder1','file3.other','key1']]
...    
```

## Miscellaneous

I also use the Firefox Split Pannel extension to view the {name}_viewpdf.html page and monitor changes to the pdf.
